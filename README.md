# Visualizing the Evolution of Website Design
Welcome to the repository for Computer Vision and Information Viz Project.

Temporal visualization of the trend of website design using low level visual features (2002 -2017) and Study how the patterns of website design have changed over time.

# Goal
Visualize the evolution of web design trend to understand the change in perspective of web designer 

# Scripts in Directory
* HSV Quantization for Color feature Extraction
* Multi Texton Histogram for Texture feature Extraction

# Description: 
The goal of the study is to determine the trend of website design over time and to identify the impact of the change in website design on technology and culture. The idea is the create an intuitive visualization to study the trend of website design over time which was the medium used by web designers to communicate information. Also, automated analysis using computer vision and machine learning will be performed to achieve this goal.

# Data: 
Screenshots of hundreds of websites over a period of almost 15 years will be used as input dataset for the analysis. Web scraper was used to obtain this dataset from the Internet Archiveâ€™s Wayback Machine. We got the data from the client.

# Why this project is important: 

This project is designed to blend the computer vision and information visualization so that we can understand the importance of low features of an image and how importance of distinctive features evolved over time. We will be using features like spatial frequency, color, texture, equilibrium and white space count as our features to analyze the images in the computer visualization part. These features will be considered to study how the website design has evolved over the time. Further, this project includes the visualization part which would enable us to identify the best visualization type and technique to represent the insights to the user in an effective way. This part will allow us to use the knowledge that we gained in the class about visualization and expand our knowledge for achieving the goal of this project.

# Discussion of related work: 
By achieving the goal of the project, we will be able to see the changes in the website design over 15 years. This analysis would lead to the prediction of future changes in the website design, which could serve as a reliable source for several purposes.
From the research perspective, previous studies concerning website evolution mainly focused on two perspectives, empirical- and theory-oriented.
The empirical-oriented branch of studies provided heuristics or checklists for the design of websites without many theoretical foundations (Flanders and Willis, 1998; Simon, 2001). For example, Cyr, Head, and Larios (2010) revealed how color affects trust or satisfaction from the users' (viewers') part. Rosen and Purinton (2004) identified several underlying dimensions of effective website design and "provided insight into design characteristics" (p.787).
The second branch showed more theoretical views. For instance, Zhang and von Dran (2000) presented a two-factor model for website design and evaluation and found that hygiene and motivator are two important aspects. Specifically, hygiene factors make a website functional and serviceable; a website lacking hygiene factors will dissatisfy users. Nevertheless, motivator factors facilitate users to have more satisfactions. Spool et al. (1999) concentrated on the tasks in information retrieval and showcased usability studies on several websites of some big companies.
Nevertheless, as far as we know, there are few studies that have researched on the evolution of website design with a temporal analysis. Therefore, this project aims to identify the trend of website design over time and the impacts of the change in website design in both technology and culture. Some automated analyses using computer vision and machine learning will be performed to achieve this goal.
